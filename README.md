# Programming-Algorithm-Practice
GitHub repository to practice solving competitive programming problems.

## Disclaimer
Despite this repo being used to practice competitive programming, I am in no way trying to be a competitive programmer. My main aim from this to gain exposure to these types of programming problems, and get more hands-on experience with Java 8 features. I will not be minifying my code, and I will happily add comments where I see fit. When solving these problems I will follow the same basic steps.

- Code the first acceptable solution that comes to mind.
- If not already, look to use Java 8 features to achieve the same solution.
- Tidy and comment code if necessary
